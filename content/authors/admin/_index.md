I’m a Ph.D. student at School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queensland University of Technology. Currently, I am researching about “Large Scale Trademark Retrieval System With Attention Mechanism” under the supervision of Sridha Sridharan at SAIVT Lab. My main research interests are computer vision, image processing and artificial intelligence. I am also interested in speech recognition,  natural language processing and robotics.
